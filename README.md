# An Explanation for This Repository’s Name

[I got tired of the peer-review
process](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller/status/1229788167223398400)
changing the names of my projects. When this happened, my repository
names would no longer make sense. [I started creating nicknames for my
projects](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller/status/1229788168049676294)
at the project’s onset, using either the Ubuntu Name Generator or the
Wu-Tang Name Generator. This led to the creation of an R
package—`{codename}`—that would do this for me. This is what came out
for this particular idea of mine.

``` r
library(codename)

message(paste0("code name generated by {codename} v.", packageVersion("codename")))
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.2.0

all_types <- c("any", "gods", "ubuntu", "wu-tang")
options(warn = -1) # this is a long seed
for (i in all_types) {
  output <- codename(type = i, seed  = "Steve’s Methods Guide: A Book on Intermediate Methods That Will Assuredly Have a Better Name When I’m Done With It")
  print(output)
}
#> [1] "purple/blue hydrogen"
#> [1] "purple/blue camulus"
#> [1] "sky sheep"
#> [1] "Tuff Conqueror"
```

I liked “sky sheep” the best, so “sky sheep” it is.
